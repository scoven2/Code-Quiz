# Code-Quiz

## Description

A coding quiz set up using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS made to help you show off your coding know-how. Utilizing numerous JS and HTML files, I was able to create a series of multiple choice questions, with only a short time to complete it, but don't rush! If you get a question wrong, you'll lose points, and time. After completing the quiz, you're able to add your initials to the Highscore list, and show off your big brain skills to others.
